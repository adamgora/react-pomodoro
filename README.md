# React PomodoroCounter

This repository is a simple Pomodoro Clock, created as a part of my React.js learning path. The idea is fairly simple. Clock is a direct implementation of a Pomodoro Method, so you can set up one pomodoro timer (default is 25 minutes) and two timers for a long and shrot break (15 and 5 minutes respectively).

Feel free to use this code however you want!
